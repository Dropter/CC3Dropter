# monitorCC3D
Arduino library and code to get Telemetry data from CC3D board.

# Motivation
Develop a well-designed and documented library to get data from CC3D board using Arduino.

# Goal
Eventually this data will be sent to a Cloud-based brain for a UAV to be able to be autonomous and lightweight at the same time.

# Based on:
OpenPilot, TauLabs and minOPOSD projects.
